# Rainfall Prediction Using Machine Learning

This project uses machine learning techniques to predict rainfall based on historical weather data.By applying data preprocessing, exploratory data analysis, and supervised learning algorithms, this project aims to develop robust predictive models that can forecast rainfall with improved accuracy. The work also includes comprehensive evaluation of model performance and visualization of results to facilitate better understanding of the underlying weather trends and model capabilities. The primary goal is to develop a predictive model to assist in forecasting rainfall, which is important for agriculture, water management, and disaster preparedness.

## Project Overview

- Data preprocessing and cleaning of the rainfall dataset.
- Training machine learning models to predict rainfall.
- Evaluating model performance using appropriate metrics.
- Visualizing the data and results within a Jupyter Notebook.

## Files Included

- `Rainfall.csv`: Dataset containing historical rainfall data.
- `RainfallPrediction.ipynb`: Jupyter Notebook with data analysis, model training, evaluation, and visualizations.
- `output.pdf`: Summary of findings and visualizations from the project.
